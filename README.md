# Sample Code for Teradata 16.20

Teradata 16.20 has new analytic capabilities. This repository is a place to test and play with the following new features:

* [Running scripts in database](in_db_scripts) - Available starting in 15.10
* [Running table operators of Aster functions that now run natively in Teradat](in_db_operators)
* [Time series aggregation](time_aggregate.sql)

## Getting Started

This repo includes code and a [small sample set](sample_data.csv) for running nPath, sessionize, python in database, and time series aggregation.

### Prerequisites

* Teradata 16.20 is required to run a majority of this code
